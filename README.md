# OBD_labeledVehicularDataBase
Labeled Vahicular database to identify safe or unsafe driving. It was made in my research in the Master in Systems Engineering.

There are two types of labeled data:

Two databases with 13 PIDs, that were recorded every 2.4s.
Four databases with 5 PIDs, that were recorded every 1s.
